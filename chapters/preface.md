# Preface

Hello and welcome to my book about computer science.
Let me briefly introduce myself.
My interest in computer science (cs for short) started already in school.
Later, I studied cs in DÃ¼sseldorf, and was honored with a doctors degree for my contributions in research in computational social choice.
I also worked as a software developer, and have lots of practical experience due to many projects.
In this book, I want to give a broader overview over several topics in cs.

Note that I write this book as a side project, and extend it only all other projects are on pause.
Thus, you might want to come back in a few months to see what's new!

Have fun reading!

Your Christian
